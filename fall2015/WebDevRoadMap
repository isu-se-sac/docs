Below is our plan for getting web development into the curriculum:

Open Forum
 - Talk about our current thoughts and ideas about web development
 - Solicit feedback from students to verify/expand on our own thoughts abot web dev
 
Create Document Defining Positions
 - Not just about Web. Dev. - all current goals of SAC
 
Pitch Positions at the Industrial Advisory Board Meeting
 - Meeting is 2-5 pm on Thursday, Oct. 22nd
 - Will need to find out how much time we have, probably have 1-2 students represent
 - Further validate/modify positions
 - Ideally get quotes, support for positions from these key people in industry
 
Begin Petitioning for Web. Dev Support
 - This petitioning would just be for the web-related goals of SAC so it is more focused
 - Should be collecting names AND emails
 - Can talk to classes, have advisors send out emails, table, reach out to alumni etc.
 - Quotes and support from leaders in industry would be immensely helpful
 
Organize small meeting with key ISU Players
 - Meet with chairs/directors of CS, SE, and CPR E and other key players
 - Breif them on support gathered
 - Consider coming up with tangible actionable items

Have a forum at the beginning of next semester
 - Have same people ^ come to be panelists
 - Start off presenting our initiatives
 - Then talk about the support we have
 - Ask them to discuss their position
 - Hopefully conversation will be lead to action items
 - Q & A with students and others present
 - Goal is to show support and apply pressure to actually make something happen
 
Follow-Up as needed
 - TBD
