# Wednesday, Oct. 7th

## Web Development

  * More languages other than JavaScript
  * More version control
  * More industry tools
  * Understanding data stacks
  * Advanced API topics

## Code Literacy

  * contributing to large-scale open code-bases - could be added to a class like 329
    * could be difficult to grade
    * how can we be sure we are actually writing "code that matters"
  * Integrate testing, debugging
  * documentation & styling

##Classes

###363
  * Get rid of OOXquery - not useful
  * Look for alternatives to SQL
  * Get rid of CyDiw - need more industry standard tools
  * Try to focus in on theory or application or both (not clear)
  * Web databases
  * More on scaling databases
  
###330

  * Add coding applications
  * Incorporate code testing
  * Proving things about code efficiency/run time
  * Possibly spread out the content over time with other classes/pre-req's
    * Recommend Math 201 as a pre-req
    * Maybe add an SE-specific math

###185 & 281

  * Need new equipment

# Thursday, Oct. 8th

## Web Development

  * Web development is lacking in our curriculum
  * Apparently we are lacking compared to other universities - time to start comparing
  * Need practical applications
  * Expand on existing web topics
  * Building servers
  
## Code Literacy

  * Start introducing concepts early
  * More debugging/testing
  * Analyzing large code bases (open source) - how to integrate into class?
  * Dependency management

## Classes

###330
  
  * Incorporate code into class
  * Class is currently theory-heavy; needs more application

###319

  * Can be improved to help prepare for 309
  * More structure needed for portfolios/projects
  * JavaSwing isn't really necessary
  * Self-driven projects are good
  
###Other

  * Need more large-scale applications
  * Data analytics - introduce concept early
  * Need more Agile
  * Need more SE projects for senior design
  * The SE Identity - more teamwork earlier on!
